# EncodingChecker v3.15.1

One reporting fix: a preview no longer calls files `Converted`. What EC detects, converts
and refuses is unchanged.

## A preview says WouldConvert

`-WhatIf`, `-Plan`, and the GUI's preview followed by **Export all results as CSV...**
wrote `Converted` in the CSV `Result` column for each file a real run would convert,
although nothing was written. On the command line, only the journal marked the run as a
preview. The `-Verbose` breakdown counted those files as `Converted` too.

A file that a preview only decided to convert is now `WouldConvert`, in the CSV (on
stdout, written with `-Report`, or exported from the GUI) and in the `-Verbose`
breakdown. `Converted` appears only for a file EC wrote. A file the run never reached
still reads `NotAttempted`. The reverse does not hold: an `Error` row may still have been
replaced, which the journal records.

## Compatibility

**The CSV `Result` column has a new value.** A script that counted `Converted` rows in a
preview or a `-Plan` run to learn what would change must now match `WouldConvert`, and a
script that checks for a fixed set of `Result` values will meet a new one. Rows from a
real run are unchanged.

The journal, the exit codes, conversion semantics (**8**), the plan schema (**6**) and the
journal schema (**6**) are unchanged. Plans written by v3.15.0 still apply.

## Verification

- 987 tests pass, none skipped; release build with no warnings.
- `docs/Test-DefectBacklog.ps1` passes: 87 findings, 76 fixed, 7 open.
- The **Shared Unicode detector parity** check is unaffected: neither shared detector
  file changed.
- The four-corpus audit was **not** run. It applies to detection and conversion-policy
  changes, and this release changes only how a preview is reported.
- **The executables are not code-signed.** The signing secrets are not configured, so
  the release workflow skips signing. Shipping unsigned is a decision for this release,
  not a passed check.

## Known open issues

Recorded in `DEFECT-BACKLOG.md`: a file name with an unpaired UTF-16 surrogate cannot be
planned or backed up (BL-43); it never changes a file's bytes.
